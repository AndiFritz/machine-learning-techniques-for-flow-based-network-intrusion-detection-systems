# Bachelor-thesis-ML-IDS
My Bachelor thesis for Bachelor Computer Science at UHasselt: An Intrusion detection system using machine learning approaches.

## Installation
 The IDS has only been tested on UNIX based systems. The IDS requires several python packages. These are all listed in `code/pip_requirements_unix.txt`. The main required elements are:
- Python 2.7+
- tshark
- sklearn (unstable branch)

## Datasets
The datasets cannot be made publically available. The thesis does show references to the different datasets that were used.

## Experiments
The results from the main experiments used in the thesis are listed in the file 'experiments.pdf'. The config files used to execute these experiments are listed in `code/configs/`.

## User & Developer guide
A user and developer guide is available within the appendix from the thesis.

## Documents
The documents folder contains the actual thesis (and latex files). Some reference material is also included.

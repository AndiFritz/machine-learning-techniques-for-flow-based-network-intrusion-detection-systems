how to correlate flow and packet
how to capture the netflow

Perhaps use both netflow and packet stream

netflow is usefull to determine top talkers, which ports are being used
  setting

netflow record:
  src IP
  dest IP
  next-hop IP
  nbpackets in flow
  Layer 3 bytes
  start time
  last time
  srcport
  destport
  tcp_flags
  ip protocol
  src_mask
  dest_mask

2 parts:
  Packet capture
  netflow capture

  netflow capture uses machine learning
  use netflow to determine overload attacks (ddos, syn)
  for weird behaviour but unknown if benign:
    set flags to use in packet capture

    packet capture uses seperate machine learning
    3 classifications:
      normal
      weird
      malicious

This document contains all the different results from the experiments that have been done for the thesis. Each chapter contains the results from the algorithm that is being described. Each algorithm has been tested using \textbf{3 different feature sets}. Each experiment has been repeated \textbf{10 times}. \\
\\
This document only contains the results from the statistically relevant tests. During the thesis, several small tests were done to quickly verify whether an assumption could be correct. These tests carry no statistical weight and have been omitted. \\
\\
The tests from the Cegeka and EDM datasets are already completely included in the thesis and have also been omitted from this document.

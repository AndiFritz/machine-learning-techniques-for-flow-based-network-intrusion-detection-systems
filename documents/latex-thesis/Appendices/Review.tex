In the past semester I have learned a lot. Together with professor Peter Quax, professor Wim Lamotte and Bram Bonne, I came up with the topic for this thesis. Personally I wanted to combine machine learning and cyber security. I did not have a deep understanding of either topic. However, I still pushed on and picked this topic. \\
\\
I started following a machine learning course from Coursera and started reading up on intrusion detection systems. I quickly realised that there was a lot of work to do. My weekly meetings with Bram Bonne allowed me to ask any questions I might have and stay on schedule with my work. \\
\\
Eventually I got my first prototype of the implementation running and I could start testing. This was quite difficult since at that time I still didn't properly understand machine learning algorithms. Once I finished the machine learning course, testing became a lot simpler to do since I knew how each algorithm worked and how it should be used. \\
\\
In the end, I have broadened my knowledge of both machine learning and intrusion detection and I had the chance to test my implementation with data received from Cegeka. It was a lot of work, as told by my mentor and advisors, but I am glad that I chose this topic.

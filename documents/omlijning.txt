Build an Intrusion prevention system (an active intrusion detection system)
This system will run on a seperate (network) device
  in between the outside and the network
(in thesis describe different kind of IPSes)

It filters all traffic based on netflow v9
  perhaps we can enhance this with actually checking packets when anomaly detected

It is supposed to be for data centers (data visualisation)

Uses machine learning techniques to detect the anomalies
do research to check which algorithms would fit the best
  implement a couple of these algorithms
